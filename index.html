        <p >I was on the hunt for a Protein Pancake Recipe but I wasn't having much success.  I found that they mostly included oats or bananas or both...and you needed to use a blender!  Bananas and oats are not my ideal sources of protein so I went to work making a stack of protein powder pancakes that were easy to make without a blender, gluten free, and are keto friendly!

            The best thing about this protein pancake recipe is that you can use any flavor protein powder you want.  You definitely want to make sure it is a protein powder that tastes really good because that is what your pancakes will taste like.  You cannot use an unflavored whey protein for this recipe.</p>

            <h1>Ingredients Needed</h1>
            <p>Cut the recipe in half to easily make 1 serving.</p>
            <ul>
                <li type="hollow-circle">2 servings of your favorite protein powder - any that you like.  it needs to be one that tastes good to you or your pancakes will not taste good!</li>
                <li type="hollow-circle">2 eggs, beaten</li>
                <li type="hollow-circle">Originally this recipe used water or almond milk as the liquid.  I had some people express that their pancakes were dry.   I went to the drawing board and discovered that the only way around this is to include fat in the batter.  Now I use either ½ cup (120g) of sour cream or full fat Greek Yogurt in place of the liquid.  I tried FF Greek Yogurt and they were still dry. <strong> You really need full fat Greek Yogurt (4% milk fat), light sour cream (10.5% milk fat), or full fat sour cream (18% milk fat)</strong>.</li>
                <li type="hollow-circle">1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Instructions Needed</h1>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Place a non-stick skillet on the stove over medium heat.  Spray with cooking spray or use a little butter or coconut oil and let melt.</li>
                <li>Mix the eggs, protein powder, and baking powder in a large bowl. Add the sour cream or Greek Yogurt and mix to combine.</li>
                <li>Using a ¼ cup measure, pour out the batter into the skillet.  I was able to make 3 at a time.  They are ready to flip when bubbles start to form on the top and around the edges are set.</li>
                <li>Serve with butter, sugar free syrup, and chocolate chips or blueberries.</li>
